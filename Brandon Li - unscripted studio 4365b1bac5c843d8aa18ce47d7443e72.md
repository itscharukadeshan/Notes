    Different Light Conditions can change the way light effects on your image for example when you set the white balance to sun light clouds can change that  
    
    as long as you’re shooting RAW you can always adjust the white balance of your images with post processing software such as Adobe Photoshop or Light-room. This is sometimes referred to as “color correction”.

    **Tint** 
    
    An image can have a color cast of any color, and color temperature only adjusts between yellow and blue. Tint adjusts the color between green and magenta. By adjusting both of these, you can remove any color cast, unless the image is practically monochrome.

    **Lavalier mics**
    
    Lavaliere microphones – also known as lapel mics or clip-on mics – are small wired microphones that are widely used in filmmaker and broadcasting. They are ideal for recording dialogue as they are discreet and unobtrusive and can be positioned close to the mouth while remaining out of sight. This ensures you can get clean, clear audio in a variety of recording situations, whether that’s vlogging, reporting to-camera, or recording an interview.

Fo**urth wall**

# **What is the fourth wall?**

**The fourth wall** is an imaginary wall that separates the story from the real world. This term comes from the theater, where the three surrounding walls enclose the stage while an invisible “4th wall” is left out for the sake of the viewer. The 4th wall is the screen we’re watching. We treat this wall like a one-way mirror. The audience can see and comprehend the story, but the story cannot comprehend the existence of the audience.
